An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements.

Here is the algorithm for finding the peak element.



int peakElement(int arr[], int n)
    {
       // Your code here
       
	int low = 0, high = n - 1;

		while(low <= high)
		{
			int mid = (low + high) / 2;

			if((mid == 0 || arr[mid - 1] <= arr[mid]) &&
				(mid == n - 1 || arr[mid + 1] <= arr[mid]))
				return mid;
			if(mid > 0 && arr[mid - 1] >= arr[mid])
				high = mid -1;
			else
				low = mid + 1;
		}
	return -1;
